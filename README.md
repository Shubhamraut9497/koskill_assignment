## Features

- JWT Authentication: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely authenticate and authorize users.
- Customer Management: Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on customer data.
- Customer Details: When a user clicks on a customer's name, they will be redirected to a page displaying detailed information about the customer, including their image, age, email, phone number, occupation, and address.
- Pagination: The customer list is paginated to enhance the user experience when there are a large number of customers.
